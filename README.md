# Speak at JSFest!

### Format

Talks are 20 minutes. There is no time for Q&A after.

All events with speakers are contained by a "narrative." Don't worry about fitting your talk in to specific narrative, that's the job of the curator, and we may add new narratives based on the proposals we get.

### What makes a good talk

Don't talk about **a** technology, tell the story of what you **did** with that technology.

Nobody ever left a conference talk with enough information in their head to write a program from what they learned. For obvious practical reasons people learn and continue to follow documentation while writing software. Don't try to teach people what is already in the documentation, tell them a story that makes them care enough to follow up with that technology.
